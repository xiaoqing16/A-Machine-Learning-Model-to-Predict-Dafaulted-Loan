    "Credit risk is one of the risk faced by financial institutions when providing loan service. It is hard to eliminate the risk but finance institutions because of the uncertainty but the risk can reduce through higher interest rates on loans and perform a credit risk assessment before approving loan to minimise the severity of a loss. Machine learning can help to improve the credit risk assessment by create a predictive model using the past data. Hence, Machine Learning plays a vital role in credit risk assessment to help the company in anticipating credit risks.\n",

    "In this problem, a supervised machine learning model will be trained to predict the probability of defaulted loan out of funded loans.\n",

    "Steps to handle overfitting\n",
    "1. The model needs to train with more data. Because the current dataset is imbalanced. Only 2.6% of data is under the defaulted loan category. Hence, the model is may not able to classify the data very well.\n",
    "2. Implement Cross-Validation on training set. we may use initial training data to generate multiple mini train-test splits. Then, use these splits to tune the model. This method can tune hyperparameters with initial training set to keep the test set as a truly unseen dataset for selecting final model.\n",
    "3. Feature Selection. After training more data, maybe we can do the feature selection again. That is because the current feature importance is based on the model and it may be not accuracy due to the imbalance data.\n",
    "4. Feature Engineering. Try to transform more raw data like date data into features to gain more information on the dataset. Because the current features may not enough to build a good model.\n",
    "5. Try with other machine learning algorithms. Other machine learning algorithms may be work better with the current one. Hence, we may to play with other machine learning algorithms to compare the performance with current one to find out which is the best algorithm for the case.\n",
